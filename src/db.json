When they arrived, they found the body of 28-year-old De’annzello McDonald.  Surveillance video showed McDonald walking up a flight of stairs with two men.  A fourth man ran towards them, and then ran away holding something in his right hand.  Based on information gathered to date, investigators believe the suspect to be a young Black man in his mid 20s, average height to 6’0” tall, with a thin frame and possibly braided hair.  The suspect was wearing a light, multi-colored top jacket, dark or black pants, and a light-colored hat.  He was seen getting into a blue or gray Ford Crown Victoria sedan.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Muegge had stab wounds and blunt force injuries on her head and neck. A knife was found in the living room, where the fire is believed to have been ignited by an accelerant. Muegge’s underwear was down around her knees; yet there were no signs of a sexual assault. In addition, a large sum of money was left in the house, however, the victim’s cell phone and wallet were never located.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two past incidents of possible interest involving Muegge occurred in the years prior to her murder, which are detailed as follows: On September 3, 2003, Muegge reported a suspicious white male in his 50s named Frank,\r\nwhom she had met through a friend. The report indicated she did not feel comfortable with this man on her property, but no further information or reports were ever documented. Separately on February 12, 2006, Muegge\r\nreported that two of her bottle-fed sheep had been shot. It was later determined that the sheep had been shot with a 22 caliber rifle.<p>\r\n\r\n",

The keys were in the ignition and Ruland’s personal possessions were in the cargo area.</p>\r\n<p>Ruland sustained a severe head injury when he was young which required a shunt implant. The initial shunt failed, necessitating a second shunt. The implants required “bilateral burr holes” so the shunts could pass through his skull. Fond du Lac Sheriff’s Office is requesting assistance with locating Ruland.</p>",
