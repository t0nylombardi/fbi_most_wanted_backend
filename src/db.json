Ida had left her husband in March 1958 and was hospitalized soon after for various illnesses. As a result, her estranged husband placed their children in a boarding home and moved to Chicago while Ida was in the hospital. The state of Michigan took custody of the children and Ida had been fighting to get them back since she was released. Arrangements had been made for Ida and her children to fly to Florida to visit family after the September 19, 1958, court date but she did not show. Prior to her disappearance, Ida remained in constant contact with her family via mail. Anyone with information regarding Ida’s disappearance is asked to contact the Ann Arbor Police Department.</p>",

Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim’s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and \"frisked\" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her. The victim cried out, which her friend heard, and then the friend called out for her and the suspect ran off. The suspect fled from the assault area on foot.</p>",

She was due in court the next day for her parental rights case and was to be awarded custody of her children, but due to conflicting court documents it is unclear if she showed up. Ida had left her husband in March 1958 and was hospitalized soon after for various illnesses. As a result, her estranged husband placed their children in a boarding home and moved to Chicago while Ida was in the hospital. The state of Michigan took custody of the children and Ida had been fighting to get them back since she was released. Arrangements had been made for Ida and her children to fly to Florida to visit family after the September 19, 1958, court date but she did not show. Prior to her disappearance, Ida remained in constant contact with her family via mail. Anyone with information regarding Ida’s disappearance is asked to contact the Ann Arbor Police Department.</p>",

The two had been at this location, which was extremely dark, for a short time, waiting for a friend, before falling asleep in the vehicle. Their seats were reclined and the vehicle was off. Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim’s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and \"frisked\" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her. The victim cried out, which her friend heard, and then the friend called out for her and the suspect ran off. The suspect fled from the assault area on foot.</p>",

According to a friend, Hein showed up in Clinton, Oklahoma, and then in early March 1983, Hein hitched a ride with the friend's father to California. They stopped for the night in Indio, California. Hein left the hotel room and has not been seen or heard from since. It was reported that Hein had thrown away his driver's license and social security card and may have had no form of identification on him.</p>",

Muegge had stab wounds and blunt force injuries on her head and neck. A knife was found in the living room, where the fire is believed to have been ignited by an accelerant. Muegge’s underwear was down around her knees; yet there were no signs of a sexual assault. In addition, a large sum of money was left in the house, however, the victim’s cell phone and wallet were never located.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two past incidents of possible interest involving Muegge occurred in the years prior to her murder, which are detailed as follows: On September 3, 2003, Muegge reported a suspicious white male in his 50s named Frank,\r\nwhom she had met through a friend. The report indicated she did not feel comfortable with this man on her property, but no further information or reports were ever documented. Separately on February 12, 2006, Muegge\r\nreported that two of her bottle-fed sheep had been shot. It was later determined that the sheep had been shot with a 22 caliber rifle.<p>\r\n\r\n",

      "details": "<p>On September 12, 1980, a 32-year-old male and his 22-year-old female companion traveled from their home state of Missouri to Iowa for a weekend getaway. They checked into the Amana Holiday Inn (along Interstate 80, just outside of Williamsburg) that evening and were found deceased the following afternoon by the motel maid. The victims had been stabbed to death, possibly with an axe or hatchet that had a 3 ½ inch blade. The male victim had seven stab wounds to his arms, hands, face, head, and neck/throat (including possible defensive wounds to his hands). The female victim had twelve stab wounds to her face, head, and neck/throat. There were no signs of forced entry into the motel room and no obvious signs of sexual assault. The victims were in bed, face-down, partly under the covers. The male victim was wearing only his underwear and the female victim was fully clothed. The victims’ personal belongings were scattered and approximately $200 was taken. Small pieces of a bar of bath soap were on the floor next to the bed. The word \"this\" was printed on the bathroom door, possibly using the bar of soap, and toothpaste was squeezed into the bathtub. Investigators have identified two cases with similarities to the instant case: the homicide of a 25-year-old male in Galesburg, Illinois, on June 24,1980 and the homicide of a 23-year-old male in Meridian, Mississippi on October 26, 1970. Like the instant case, the Galesburg and Meridian victims were away from home and staying in a motel room just off a busy Interstate. Additionally, in all three cases, toothpaste was found in an unusual location at the crime scene, the weapon used is believed to be a machete or sort of axe/hatchet, and money was taken. </p>\r\n<p>If you have information relevant to this investigation, or know of other cases that resemble the details of this homicide (e.g., victim(s) was killed in a motel room near a busy interstate; weapon used was an axe, hatchet, or machete; toothpaste or soap was found in an unusual location at the crime scene; writing or drawings were left at the crime scene), please contact the agency below.  </p>\r\n<p>&lt;p&gt;To provide or request additional information, please contact: Captain Todd Sauerbrei, Iowa County Sheriff’s Office, Iowa, (319) 642-7307, TSauerbrei@iowacosheriff.org - - FBI ViCAP, (800) 634-4097, vicap@fbi.gov </p>",

She was due in court the next day for her parental rights case and was to be awarded custody of her children, but due to conflicting court documents it is unclear if she showed up. Ida had left her husband in March 1958 and was hospitalized soon after for various illnesses. As a result, her estranged husband placed their children in a boarding home and moved to Chicago while Ida was in the hospital. The state of Michigan took custody of the children and Ida had been fighting to get them back since she was released. Arrangements had been made for Ida and her children to fly to Florida to visit family after the September 19, 1958, court date but she did not show. Prior to her disappearance, Ida remained in constant contact with her family via mail. Anyone with information regarding Ida’s disappearance is asked to contact the Ann Arbor Police Department.</p>",

The two had been at this location, which was extremely dark, for a short time, waiting for a friend, before falling asleep in the vehicle. Their seats were reclined and the vehicle was off. Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim’s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and \"frisked\" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her. The victim cried out, which her friend heard, and then the friend called out for her and the suspect ran off. The suspect fled from the assault area on foot.</p>",

      "details": "<p>On Sunday, June 17, 2012, at approximately 2200 hours, a female was sexually assaulted on the shoulder of South Foothills Hwy (Hwy 93), just south of Boulder city limits. The victim was lost and had stopped on the highway shoulder to update her GPS. The offender approached her driver’s side window and asked if she was okay. He then ordered her out of the vehicle and displayed a handgun, possibly a small compact, black, semi-automatic. The suspect ordered the victim to the backseat of his vehicle, described as a late model Jeep Cherokee, or similar, gray or blue in color with cloth fabric. The victim was sexually assaulted in the backseat of the suspect’s vehicle. After the assault, the victim was ordered out of the car and left at the side of the road. The suspect was last seen making a U-turn and driving back towards Boulder.</p>\r\n<p>The victim did not recall seeing the suspect’s vehicle on the shoulder when she first stopped and did not see the suspect’s vehicle pull up behind her. The description of the suspect is vague, and it is believed he was a white male, approximately 5’11” in height.</p>\r\n<p>After further interviews with the victim, she was able to provide additional details about the offender: a white male with longer; bondish arm hair. He had rough hands similar to a person who works with his hands. She described a tattoo on his upper left arm, possibly green in color, circle shape. She was only able to see the lower portion of the tattoo, due to a short-sleeve shirt covering the rest of the tattoo.</p>",

Jain</a>, is wanted for his alleged involvement in an international cybercrime scheme that caused internet users in more than 60 countries to purchase more than one million bogus software products, resulting in consumer loss of more than $100 million. It is alleged that from December 2006 to October 2008, through fake advertisements placed on legitimate companies’ websites, Sundin and his accomplices deceived internet users into believing that their computers were infected with “malware” or had other critical errors in order to encourage them to purchase “scareware” software products that had limited or no ability to remedy the purported defects.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Sundin and his co-conspirators allegedly deceived victims, through browser hijacking, multiple fraudulent scans and false error messages, into purchasing full paid versions of software products offered by their company, Innovative Marketing, Inc. The proceeds of these credit card sales were allegedly deposited into bank accounts controlled by the defendant and others around the world, and were then transferred to bank accounts located in Europe. When customers complained that their purchases were actually fraudulent software, call center representatives were allegedly instructed to lie or provide refunds in order to prevent fraud reports to law enforcement or credit companies.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2010, Sundin was indicted in Chicago, Illinois, by a federal grand jury for the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois. He was indicted for wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and computer fraud. That same day, a federal warrant was issued for Sundin’s arrest.</p>",

It is alleged that from December 2006 to October 2008, through fake advertisements placed on legitimate companies’ websites, Jain and his accomplices deceived internet users into believing that their computers were infected with “malware” or had other critical errors in order to encourage them to purchase “scareware” software products that had limited or no ability to remedy the purported defects.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Jain and his co-conspirators allegedly deceived victims, through browser hijacking, multiple fraudulent scans and false error messages, into purchasing full paid versions of software products offered by their company, Innovative Marketing, Inc. The proceeds of these credit card sales were allegedly deposited into bank accounts controlled by the defendant and others around the world, and were then transferred to bank accounts located in Europe. When customers complained that their purchases were actually fraudulent software, call center representatives were allegedly instructed to lie or provide refunds in order to prevent fraud reports to law enforcement or credit companies.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2010, Jain was indicted in Chicago, Illinois, by a federal grand jury for the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois. He was indicted for wire fraud, conspiracy to commit computer fraud and computer fraud. That same day, a federal warrant was issued for Jain’s arrest.</p>",

Diaz-Juarez, reportedly one of the most violent individuals in the organization, is the only remaining fugitive in the case.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>As reported to the FBI, it is alleged that the following criminal activities occurred. The criminal acts in the conspiracy involve acts committed by Diaz-Juarez and others against undocumented Mexican women and children. The sex-trafficking conspiracy operated from 1999 through October 2013 and relied on “padrotes,” or pimps, to supply women and girls for the brothels, bars, and cantinas owned and operated by co-conspirators. Diaz-Juarez is one of these pimps. During the investigation, it was revealed that some women and girls were compelled into performing commercial sex acts through the use of force, fraud, coercion, or a combination thereof, including the use of locked rooms to maintain control over the young women and girls. Diaz-Juarez used force and/or violence to punish and control young females he prostituted in the Houston area.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On October 10, 2013, a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, after Diaz-Juarez was charged with sex-trafficking conspiracy and conspiracy to harbor illegal aliens.</p>",

Guevara-Mejia then succeeded in forcing the victim into the hotel room where he allegedly forced her onto the bed and shot her in her right foot and then the left foot.

Reports in this case allege the following: On July 5, 1997, Francisco Molina-Neave and his girlfriend attended a holiday party in the Denver Metro area. While driving home from the party, Molina-Neave, who was seated in the front passenger seat, began punching his girlfriend as she was driving. She stopped the car and pulled over. Molina-Neave got out and walked around to the driver’s side of the car where he continued to beat his girlfriend.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The assault continued until a passer-by showed up and ran over to the girlfriend. Molina-Neave then fled the area. The passer-by flagged down a vehicle occupied by additional witnesses who reportedly saw the beating. The passer-by asked the witnesses in the car to attempt to locate the suspect. They agreed to help and spotted Molina-Neave a short distance away. They told Molina-Neave to stop and that they had called the police. The suspect fled down an alley as police arrived. While setting up the perimeter the police heard two gunshots fired from the alley where the suspect was last seen. The gunshots were fired by two different guns. The officers observed the witness vehicle speed out of the alley. The witnesses were screaming that the same suspect, along with another Hispanic male, had allegedly shot at them and their vehicle. One of the occupants in the vehicle was screaming that she had been shot as well.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On January 21, 1999, a jury found Francisco Molina-Neave guilty on charges of first degree assault, attempted first degree assault, prohibited use of a weapon, and third degree assault. Molina-Neave fled from the courtroom as the verdict was read. A warrant was then issued for his arrest. On May 17, 2006, Francisco Molina-Neave was arrested on the warrant from Denver in San Antonio, Texas. He refused extradition, and a Texas court allowed him to post bond pending his extradition appeal. The suspect failed to appear and was arrested in mid-May of 2007. The Texas court set his bond for one million dollars. Molina-Neave posted the bond and was released. His appeal was denied on October 4, 2007, and he fled again. On March 13, 2008, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Molina-Neave, and he was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.</p>",

      "details": "<p>On July 20, 1975, Janis Kay Sanders, a 24-year-old White female, went to work at her job in Niles, Michigan, and was never heard from again after her shift. One week prior to her disappearance, Sanders had broken up with her boyfriend, who is considered a suspect at this time. Witnesses reported her ex-boyfriend following Sanders out of her place of work the last night she was seen. Sanders is described as 5’4”, 115 pounds, having auburn hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a black jumper, black panty hose, rose color long sleeve collared shirt, white shoes, gold watch with a black leather band, gold earrings, and a diamond butterfly ring. Police believe this is connected to the missing persons case of Janeice Langs, a White female, who disappeared from South Bend, Indiana, around November 9, 1973. Langs and Sanders had the same former partner prior to their disappearance. Anyone with information regarding Sanders’ disappearance is asked to contact the Michigan State Police Department, Violent Crimes Unit.</p>",

The video stopped at that point, but the victim also noted that the man had a tattoo on the webbing of his right hand. The female exited her vehicle and the man pulled out a black handgun. He told her to shut up and get in the car. She sat in the car, and he struck her. He tore her shirt open, then put zip ties on her arms. He was going to put another clear industrial strength zip tie on her arms and set the gun on her. She grabbed the gun, threw it, and was able to escape in her vehicle.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

He fled from the United States on February 16, 2021, and is currently believed to be in Belarus. Neumann was initially charged in a criminal complaint filed on March 23, 2021. A federal arrest warrant was issued for Neumann in the United States District Court, District of Columbia, on December 10, 2021.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>It is alleged that Neumann participated in numerous violent acts against multiple law enforcement officers performing their legal duties of protecting the U.S Capitol Building on January 6, 2021.  Neumann allegedly fought with U.S. Capitol Police and Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department officers both inside and outside the U.S. Capitol.  During these physical altercations, Neumann not only used his hands and fists to strike the officers, he also allegedly used a metal barricade as a battering ram against the officers.  Neumann also appears to have remained on restricted grounds late into the day and evening, continuing to resist repeated orders by law enforcement to leave the restricted grounds.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The charges relate to the actions by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to target Iranian dissidents. The regime views these dissidents as enemies of the state because of their criticism of the regime’s human rights violations, and their public statements against the Iranian Government. Since at least approximately 2019, the Government of Iran has allegedly lured several expatriate Iranian dissidents to locations where they were arrested or kidnapped and sent to Iran for imprisonment and execution.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The men also allegedly conspired to kidnap and/or lure a United States citizen, as well as victims residing in other countries. They allegedly hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on an individual in furtherance of a plot to kidnap or harm the victim based on their anti-regime activism. Farahani is an Iranian intelligence official who allegedly manages a network of sources for Iranian intelligence, including Mahmoud Khazein, Omid Noori, and Kiya Sadeghi.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In July of 2021, Farahani, Sadeghi, Khazein, and Noori were indicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, on the charges listed above and federal warrants were issued for their arrests.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The roads in that area of northern New Hampshire were snow-covered at the time. Murray was not present at the crash scene when police arrived and has not been seen or heard from since. Murray was last seen on surveillance footage earlier in the day at an ATM wearing a dark jacket and jeans. Prior to that, Murray had left the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she was studying nursing. Murray did not share with others her pending trip to New Hampshire, which was about 2.5 hours away. Murray received prior education at the United States Military Academy at West Point, was an avid runner, and enjoyed hiking in the White Mountains. An age progression impression of what Murray might look like today was released in February of 2024.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Shultz had previously worked in construction; however, no wages have been reported since 1994. At the time of his disappearance, he did not have access to a vehicle. Personal belongings were left in the victim’s home and foul play is suspected. He was known to frequent bars and was a drug and alcohol user.

However, the victim’s nurse’s uniform was not in the laundry basket and her vehicle, a red Pontiac Fiero, was missing and has not been located since. It was rumored the victim may have gone to Mexico. Chauncey was known to have been dating a married man, during the relationship the man’s wife keyed Chauncey’s vehicle.

Emms allegedly took steps in an effort to conceal their activity, and the expert's role in the conspiracy, from United States authorities.  The expert was arrested by United States authorities in November of 2019, disrupting the scheme.  At no time did Emms, or co-conspirator <a data-val=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/alejandro-cao-de-benos\" data-linktype=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/counterintelligence/alejandro-cao-de-benos\" data-urltype=\"/view\">Alejandro Cao de Benós</a>, obtain permission from the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), to provide goods, services, or technology to the DPRK, as is required by law.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A federal arrest warrant was issued for Emms in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, New York, New York, on January 27, 2022, after he was charged with Conspiracy to Violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The conspiracy comprised North Korean hacking groups that some private cybersecurity researchers have labeled the “Lazarus Group” and Advanced Persistent Threat 38 (APT38). For his part in the conspiracy, Kim is alleged to have been directly involved in the development and dissemination of a malicious cryptocurrency application, in cyber-enabled heists from financial institutions, and in the Marine Chain initial coin offering. On December 8, 2020, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Kim in the United States District Court, Central District of California, after he was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud (computer intrusions).</p>",

The charges relate to the actions by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to target Iranian dissidents. The regime views these dissidents as enemies of the state because of their criticism of the regime’s human rights violations, and their public statements against the Iranian Government. Since at least approximately 2019, the Government of Iran has allegedly lured several expatriate Iranian dissidents to locations where they were arrested or kidnapped and sent to Iran for imprisonment and execution.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The men also allegedly conspired to kidnap and/or lure a United States citizen, as well as victims residing in other countries. They allegedly hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on an individual in furtherance of a plot to kidnap or harm the victim based on their anti-regime activism. Noori allegedly facilitated payments to a private investigator in the United States in furtherance of the kidnapping plot.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In July of 2021, Noori, Farahani, Khazein, and Sadeghi were indicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, on the charges listed above and federal warrants were issued for their arrests</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Ringler was found in his office, which was in disarray and money was missing from the office safe.</p>\r\n<p>The offender is believed to have entered the restaurant shortly before closing and spent some time at the bar. Also, an unidentified white pick-up truck containing two White males was seen outside of the restaurant around closing time.</p>\r\n<p>The offender was described as a White male, 20 to 30 years old, who stood approximately 5’8” to 5’10” tall. He had sandy-blond hair that was combed straight back. He was clean shaven, neat looking, and spoke slowly without a defined accent. He talked to several restaurant employees and used the phrase, “short of two hoofs and a horn.” He was also a cigarette smoker.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The victim was 5’7” and weighed 142 pounds.. He had what appeared to be a faded, small tattoo on his back (unknown what the tattoo shows), as well as extensive gold dental work.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>During the autopsy, he was found to have suffered from Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He had several medications in his system, including ones used typically as antidepressants and short-term insomnia relief. He also had a stent in the left anterior descending artery of his heart. Investigators believe the victim may be from outside the country as his stent did not have a serial number or any identifiers, which is uncharacteristic for the United States for what the victim’s suspected age is.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The charges relate to the actions by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to target Iranian dissidents. The regime views these dissidents as enemies of the state because of their criticism of the regime’s human rights violations, and their public statements against the Iranian Government. Since at least approximately 2019, the Government of Iran has allegedly lured several expatriate Iranian dissidents to locations where they were arrested or kidnapped and sent to Iran for imprisonment and execution.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The men also allegedly conspired to kidnap and/or lure a United States citizen, as well as victims residing in other countries. They allegedly hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance on an individual in furtherance of a plot to kidnap or harm the victim based on their anti-regime activism. Sadeghi allegedly facilitated payments and communications to a private investigator in the United States in furtherance of the kidnapping plot.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In July of 2021, Sadeghi, Khazein, Noori, and Farahani were indicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, on the charges listed above and federal warrants were issued for their arrests. </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Jane Doe is estimated to have been killed during the late 1970s to early 1980s by undetermined means. It is believed that Jane Doe was not originally from New Hampshire.  She was 2 to 4 years old at the time of her death, with slightly wavy brown hair, and approximately 3’3” to 3'9\" tall. She had a slight overbite that may have been noticeable.  An analysis of her bones suggests that she may have had anemia in life, but this cannot be confirmed. No clothing or personal items were recovered with her. DNA testing revealed Jane Doe's biological father is Terrence \"Terry\" Peder Rasmussen, who died in a California prison in 2010 after being convicted of the 2002 murder of his common-law wife.  Jane Doe's biological mother is unknown.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The victim was found with a white shirt with a yellow and black print smiley face, white skirt, white socks with low cut black and white gym shoes. A “Teddy Bear” watch with a leather band was found on her left arm. Initially, Clevidence was listed as Unidentified Remains until 2023, when she was identified through Forensic Genetic Genealogy. Investigators are asking anyone with information regarding this case to please come forward.</p>",

However, the medication that was alleged to have been given to the patients was medically unnecessary and often never given to the patients. The patients received kickbacks for their Medicare information. The Benitez brothers then allegedly opened sham companies to launder millions of dollars coming into the clinics from Medicare.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On May 22, 2008, the Benitez brothers were indicted by a Federal Grand Jury for the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, for conspiracy to defraud the United States, to cause the submission of false claims, and to pay health care kickbacks; conspiracy to commit health care fraud; submission of false claims; money laundering conspiracy; and money laundering.

      "details": "<p>During the course of their relationship, Francina Fernandez and her boyfriend had three boys, who are now adults. The couple never married and in June of 2001 the relationship ended. The two became embroiled in a very lengthy and aggressive custody-visitation dispute in the San Diego Family Court. In early November of 2004, the mother reportedly mentioned to the father that she and the children were planning a 2-week vacation in New Zealand. He told her that the trip would violate the court orders, and Fernandez's attorney was served with a notice of an ex-parte hearing scheduled for November 8, 2004.  At the hearing, a judge ordered that neither parent could take the children out of the jurisdiction of the court and that the children's passports were to be relinquished. The passports were never returned. Also, in November it was reported that Fernandez abruptly left her job and a relative filed a missing person's report for her. Fernandez may have fled with her children to the Philippines.<br /><br />On December 9, 2004, a state warrant was issued in the state of California, San Diego County, charging Francina Dacanay Fernandez with three counts of child abduction. A federal arrest warrant was subsequently issued on February 4, 2005, in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, charging Fernandez with international parental kidnapping.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

That order has yet to be executed, and the child remains in Argentina.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On March 26, 2012, the Florida Miami-Dade Family Court issued a final judgment, finding Reyes to be Michael's natural and biological father, and ordered physical and legal custody of Michael to Reyes.
