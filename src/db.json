Arrangements had been made for Ida and her children to fly to Florida to visit family after the September 19, 1958, court date but she did not show.

Muegge had stab wounds and blunt force injuries on her head and neck. A knife was found in the living room, where the fire is believed to have been ignited by an accelerant. Muegge’s underwear was down around her knees; yet there were no signs of a sexual assault. In addition, a large sum of money was left in the house, however, the victim’s cell phone and wallet were never located.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two past incidents of possible interest involving Muegge occurred in the years prior to her murder, which are detailed as follows: On September 3, 2003, Muegge reported a suspicious white male in his 50s named Frank,\r\nwhom she had met through a friend. The report indicated she did not feel comfortable with this man on her property, but no further information or reports were ever documented. Separately on February 12, 2006, Muegge\r\nreported that two of her bottle-fed sheep had been shot. It was later determined that the sheep had been shot with a 22 caliber rifle.<p>\r\n\r\n",
